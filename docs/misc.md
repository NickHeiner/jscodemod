# Misc
This library does not bundle Piscina [the way its authors recommend](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina#multiple-thread-pools-and-embedding-piscina-as-a-dependency). I am almost entirely certain that recommendation does not apply in this case, but I look forward to the first issue proving me wrong. :)

## Mascot Inspiration
"codmod" is a typical misspelling of codemod. I should use create a friendly modified cod logo.
